# ZTF Forced Photometry lightcurves

Redoployed on https://ztfphot.azurewebsites.net

This is a library and script for dealing with ZTF forced photometry lightcurves of transient.
Files can be generated by the ZTF Forced Photometry Service (ZTFFPS: no affliation)
or via your own forced photometry using ZTF data releases.

Under construction...

Currently ztfphot can: 
 - Read ZTFFPS lightcurves.
 - Perform various cleaning methods.
 - Plot the raw flux for help in determining baseline JD.
 - Create lightcurves that are corrected for baseline.
 - Scale uncertainties
 - Plot the magnitude or flux lightcurve in any ztfband.

 Upcoming:
 - [ ] Method for fetching data from IRSA.
 - [ ] Own implementation of Forced photometry compatible with ZTFFPS.
 - [x] Interactive setting of the baseline.
 - [x] Dynamically dealing with references that contain transient flux.
 - [x] Hosted (ztfphot.herokuapp.com)
 - [ ] Alternative upper limit calculation and parameter visualizations.
 - [ ] Allow querying ztf forced photometry service at IRSA using own credentials.
